I wrote a simple code that saves most of the data scientists time in visualization.It is a python script that requires only a 
dataset(csv,excel,etc.) as input and target column needs to be specified so that it will automaticaly plot all possible 
graphs(univariate,Bivariate and Multivariate) with little analysis (skeweness,outliers,correlation value etc.).

Ship_Crew_Size_ML_Model.ipynb: the jupyter notebook containing code.
